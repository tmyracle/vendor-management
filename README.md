# vendor-management

## purpose

This is a basic SaaS app to let companies manage their vendors. It's purpose is to give me something to work on to
make sure I don't forget how to build things. It also allows me to learn new things and give me something to tinker on
since I don't think it'll ever be "done".

## learning

So far building this has allowed me to learn how to:

- Implement authentication with JWT
- Implement password reset
- Separating React app into authenticated and public routes
- Using axios to interact with my Rails API
- Send sign up and password reset emails with Sendgrid
- Store files and images using ActiveStorage with AWS S3
- Set up and write unit tests for my Rails API

## stack

For this app I'm using:

- Rails for API backend
- React for the front end
- Tailwind UI and Tailwind CSS for styling
- AWS S3 for file storage
- Sendgrid for emails
- JWT for authentication
- RSpec for API testing
- Heroku for deployment and hosting (eventually)
